Hello {{customer.firstName}}!

Thanks for reaching out! We’re excited about your interest in Fear Free. I’m happy to provide you with additional information on the Fear Free Veterinary Certification Programs.

All the veterinary certification programs are designed for all individuals employed at a practice—from veterinarians and veterinary nurses/technicians to customer service representatives and practice managers. The certification programs are seen as the foundation for Fear Free and designed to give individuals the knowledge and tools required to start implementing Fear Free in their workplace.

The purchase of the veterinary certification membership provides you with access to all the veterinary certification programs, additional RACE-approved courses, helpful resources, a listing in our online directory, exclusive discounts, and more! The membership requires an annual renewal fee and completion of additional annual CE to maintain your certification.

To register a group, you will be required to set up a team admin account. This account is free and is intended to manage the team members enrolled in our program. This account does not have access to courses, nor can it get certified. It will need a unique email that is not going to be used for any team member accounts. If you are acting as the team admin and plan to also complete the certification program, please note that you will need a different email address for each account. You can view a short walkthrough video to help you navigate the team admin account: https://youtu.be/jvdmRuhcUyg.

You can view the course overview, certification requirements, annual renewal requirements, and pricing here.

You can also view the additional education we have for veterinary professionals here.

Let us know if you have any questions! To register, simply navigate to fearfreepets.com, click Get Started, select I am signing up myself and others, select Veterinary Certification Membership and how many individuals you would like to sign up, and check out!

We wish you the best on your Fear Free journey! Let us know how we can support you and your team.
